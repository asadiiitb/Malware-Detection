# Malware-Detection
In this Machine Learning Project we solved "Microsoft Malware Prediction: Can you predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware?" (Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction) Problem.
As this was an assignment so the base problem's database was skewed and then given to us for solving the problem.
This was a group project so kudos to my mates @nikk1212 and Abhishek Garg for this amazing work.
